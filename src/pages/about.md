Since graduating from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts with a major in Film and Television and History in 2009, I have been a professional location sound mixer. The location sound mixer is responsible for selecting, preparing and deploying an array of microphones, radio transmitters, and recorders to capture and organize dialog on location for TV and movies. The role requires incredible attention to detail, technical knowledge, management skills, and communication with other departments across disciplines to manage competing interests in the service of a collaborative creative product.

My passion for the web began earlier when, in middle school, my mother showed me how she learned HTML and put together a website for her workplace. At NYU I took a few computer science courses and learned Java and JavaScript. Over the years I learned jQuery, AngularJS, and React along with all of the tooling that accompanies modern JavaScript development. Now building responsive, accessible, interactive user interfaces is all I want to do everyday.
